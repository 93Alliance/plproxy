== Near future ==

 * Clean up the binary-or-not decision.  There should be possible
   to have partitions with different versions.  That may mean
   lazy typeout generations.

 * Allow missing RUN in CLUSTER functions, which would mean `RUN ON 0;`
   This should be useful for single-partition clusters.

 * Lazy value type cache, per-conn binary I/O decision.

== Just thoughts ==

 * A way to give config to CONNECT functions.
   - SET param = xxx; ???
 * Dynamic connstr loading for CONNECT functions?
 * RUN ON ALL: sort by?
 * RUN ON ALL: ignore errors?
 * RUN ON ANY: if one con failed, try another
 * Streaming for big resultsets, to avoid loading them fully in memory.
   This needs also backend changes.
 * Drop CONNECT, SELECT, plproxy.get_cluster_config()...
 * Debug a way to survive AS syntax with different types.

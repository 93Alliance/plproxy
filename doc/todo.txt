== next version: 2.0.3 ==

=== done ===

 * support 8.3
 * fix "make deb"
 * client_encoding: before sending query, sync if needed
 * client_encoding: the warning is not necessary anymore
 * support both older (2.5.4) and newer (2.5.33) flex
 * quoting for function name and result columns
 * fetch columns explicitly
 * drop statement_timeout

=== todo ===

 * updated docs
   - move docs to asciidoc
   - include Steve's intro

== Near future ==

 * Clean up the binary-or-not decision.  There should be possible
 to have partitions with different versions.  That may mean
 lazy typeout generations.

== Just thoughts ==

 * A way to give config to CONNECT functions.
   - SET param = xxx; ???
 * Dynamic connstr loading for CONNECT functions?
 * RUN ON ALL: sort by?
 * RUN ON ALL: ignore errors?
 * RUN ON ANY: if one con failed, try another
 * Streaming for big resultsets, to avoid loading them fully in memory.
   This needs also backend changes.

#pragma section-numbers 2

== Language Syntax ==

The language contains only 4 statements: CONNECT, CLUSTER, RUN and SELECT.

Each function needs to have either CONNECT or CLUSTER+RUN statement
to specify where to run the function.  The SELECT statement is optional,
if it is missing, there will be default query generated based on proxy
function signature.

=== CONNECT ===
`CONNECT 'libpq connstr';`
}}}

=== CLUSTER ===

`CLUSTER 'cluster_name' | cluster_func(..);`

=== RUN ON ===
{{{

RUN ON (partition_func(..) | ALL | ANY | <NR>) ;

}}}
 * Arguments for hashfunc and SELECT can be both $1 and full name.
 * Hashfunc can return "setof int4", several servers are tagged then.
 * If query is ran on several server, the execution will happen in parallel.

=== SELECT ===
{{{
SELECT .... ;
}}}

By default runs SELECT * from funcname(..); on remote side
where funcname is name of plproxy function.  
 * Result fields will be mapped on name.

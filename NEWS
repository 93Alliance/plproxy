2007-11-xx  -  PlProxy 2.0.3  -  "Faster Than A Fresh Zombie"

    = Features =

    * Explicitly specify result column names and types in query.

      Lets say there is function somefunc(out id int4, out data text).
      Previously pl/proxy issued following query:

        SELECT * FROM somefunc()
      
      And later tried to work out which column goes where.  Now it issues:

        SELECT id::int4, data::text from somefunc()
      
      

    * Quote function and result column names properly.
    * Set client_encoding on remote database to be equal to local one.
    * Now setting 'statement_timeout' from plproxy.works, but 

    = Fixes =

    * Support 8.3 (short varlena header)
    * Support old flex (2.5.4)
    * Fix 'make deb'

2007-04-16  -  PlProxy 2.0.2  -  "No news is good news?"

    * Include plproxy.sql.in in tgz.
    * Clean add_connection() function by using StringInfo instead
      open-coded string shuffling.
